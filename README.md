# personal-site-2

Grabbed the HTML from the old Zend Application since I don't want to maintain a legacy framework on a legacy EC2 instance.

This is configured using GitHub pages in the `/docs` directory. It is a purely static site.
Once you push to the `master` branch, the site will be updated. No special build process like with the wedding site. 
HTML has specific link if the resume has to be updated.
